# IDS-Messaging-Services

Each participant in an IDS-Data-Ecosystem must be able to communicate with other participants in the Data-Ecosystem. Even though different participants may have different implementations of IDS-Connectors, they all have in common that IDS-Messages need to be sent and received. This commonality is addressed by the IDS-Messaging-Services, which provide a lightweight available implementation of IDS-Message-Handling. The IDS-Messaging-Services offer open-source functionality for sending IDS-Messages as well as interfaces for processing received IDS-Messages. The architecture relies on a modern modular architecture-approach so that the functionalities needed for communication in a Data-Ecosystem can be easily selected specific to the infrastructure components present in the Data-Ecosystem. In addition, advanced functionalities are implemented, such as checking the validity of the Dynamic-Attribute-Token of incoming messages.
